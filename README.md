## Setup

You need npm and gulp installed to install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/matthewelse/solar-kms
cd solar-kms
npm install
cd semantic
gulp build
```

The root directory of the solar-kms repo now contains all you need to run the front end. You
can run this to try it out:

```bash
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
open localhost:8000
```
